<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Follow these steps in order to run ruby code.

### Prerequisites

First, you need to ensure that you have Ruby installed on your computer.

### Setup

It varies depending on your operating system so here are some links to help you install it on [Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) and on [Ubuntu](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#apt).

For MacOS run the following commands

```sh
  brew install rbenv ruby-build
  # Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
  echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
  source ~/.bash_profile

  # Install Ruby
  rbenv install 3.0.1
  rbenv global 3.0.1
  ruby -v
```

This example shows how to install Ruby 3.0.1 which was the latest version in April 2021, but you can check to see if there is a newer version [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/releases/). Iy is also assumed that you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) already installed on your Mac.

### Usage

Once you have ruby installed, [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and run the command `ruby main.rb`

**For running tests**
run the following command: `rspec test/*`
